# EEG_study

up until now there is a Beginning screen and the rooms: by pressing a, b or c you reach the scenes with the rooms

there are 3 scenes, each with one Room: all of them have the same basic funiture and I already started colouring them in blue/pink/neutral colours
they are still missing toys/decorations and of course you can change what is already there
There is no code for the rooms yet, i.e. a player or sth. similar
